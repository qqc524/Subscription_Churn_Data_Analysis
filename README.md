# Subscription Churn Data Analysis with Python

This project analyzes subscription churn data from a video streaming service. The dataset represents a sample of subscriptions initiated in 2021, with snapshots taken at specific points before customers canceled their subscriptions. It is designed to help analyze patterns and trends associated with customer churn.

## Dataset Overview

The dataset provides valuable information that reflects customer behavior and decision-making, including:

- Subscription details and timelines.
- Patterns leading to cancellation, such as a lack of engagement, busy schedules, or a mismatch with customer needs.
- Insights into retention challenges faced by subscription-based services.

## Project Goal

Using this data, we will:

- Explore and understand key factors behind customer churn through **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**.
- Identify trends and patterns to inform strategies for improving customer retention.
- Gain actionable insights to help subscription-based services reduce churn and increase customer satisfaction.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib & Seaborn for visualization
- Scikit-learn (predictive modeling will be included)
