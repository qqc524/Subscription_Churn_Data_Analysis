# Subscription Churn Data Analysis with Python

This dataset comes from a video streaming service and represents a sample of subscriptions initiated in 2021. The data includes snapshots taken at a specific point in time before customers canceled their subscriptions. It is designed to help analyze patterns and trends associated with customer churn.

The dataset provides valuable information that reflects customer behavior and decision-making, including:

- Subscription details and timelines.
- Patterns leading to cancellation, such as a lack of engagement, busy schedules, or a mismatch with customer needs.
- Insights into retention challenges faced by subscription-based services.

With this data, we will explore and understand the key factors behind customer churn using exploratory data analysis (EDA). This will help create better strategies for improving customer retention.
